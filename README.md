# eBird-Targets

The first version of this script was written to help me prepare for an eleven day birding trip to South and West Texas. Several other birders had shared their eBird trip reports with me. These reports were incredibly helpful, but synthesizing everything was difficult. This script was written to help create something digestible that would allow me to focus on study species and to help in planning daily trip agendas. A trip to Costa Rica prompted a rewrite to streamline and minimize manual steps.
