# eBird-Targets

The first version of this script was written to help me prepare for an eleven day birding trip to South and West Texas. Several other birders had shared their eBird trip reports with me. These reports were incredibly helpful, but synthesizing the information was difficult. This script was written to help create something digestible that would allow me to focus on species to study, and to help in planning daily trip agendas.
